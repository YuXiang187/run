# Subordinate clause

## Object clause

Statement sentence: that
General interrogative sentence: if/whether
Special interrogative sentence: what, who, which, when, where, how

**Negative words are often placed before the main verb, rather than within the clause.**

Correct: I don't think (that) the rabbit is smart.
Incorrect: I think (that) the rabbit ~~isn't~~ smart.

**Tense of the main clause = Tense of the subordinate clause.**

e.g. I **knew** (that) the rabbit **liked** carrots.

but, the objective phenomenon is an exception.

e.g. I **knew** (that) the sun **rises** in the east.
